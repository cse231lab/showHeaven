\textbf{Introduction }

Imagine if Twitter and IMDB had a crossover. That's what this website
aims to be. It will be like a social media website, but instead of
people's lives being shared, it's their love/hatred for TV shows. People
will be able to connect and share their experiences with certain shows.
They can make decisions as to whether they should invest into a show by
seeing what others are saying about it. Most of the shows a person
watches is because someone else told them to watch it, so this site will
take it a step further.

\textbf{Objective}

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\square$]
  Get Information About Shows
\item[$\square$]
  Find shows of similar categories
\item[$\square$]
  User can share favorite shows with others
\item[$\square$]
  See others review and ratings about the show and share their views
\item[$\square$]
  Help recommend show
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Target Users}

Users of various types of tastes for shows from anime to tv shows can
get to know about shows and share about their views on shows.

\textbf{Value Proposition }

People when looking for a show to watch may find it hard to find a good
one. With this site they can look into data to find what other users
think about the show and make their decision. They can also help others
to decide on shows and share their favourite watchlist. They can see
others' watchlists and if their taste matches they follow them and it
will help them find shows easily in the future. They can share their own
reviews for shows.

\textbf{Web Application Feature and description}

The web page will have sign in/ sign up options. If the user is signed
in they can see their profile where they can see information about them.
Anyone can see that profile and only the owner of the account can edit
information. There will be three types of users-

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\square$]
  Admin
\item[$\square$]
  Moderator
\item[$\square$]
  General
\end{itemize}

General users can do the followings-

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\square$]
  Rate Shows
\item[$\square$]
  Post comments about show and edit their comments
\item[$\square$]
  Create private/public watchlists
\item[$\square$]
  Request for shows with data
\item[$\square$]
  Follow others public watch list
\end{itemize}

Moderator will have all benefits of general users with following added
benefits-

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\square$]
  Approve show requests
\item[$\square$]
  Delete comments
\end{itemize}

Admins will have following benefits in additions to all benefits of
moderators-

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\square$]
  Delete users
\item[$\square$]
  Make others admin/moderator
\end{itemize}

Every show will have a show page. All show will contain following
things-

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\square$]
  Cover picture
\item[$\square$]
  Informations like release date,category, number of episodes/seasons
  and brief introduction
\item[$\square$]
  The page will also contain reviews of the show left by others. A
  scoring system will be used to calculate the average review of a show.
\end{itemize}

Each user can create watchlists where they can see any show added in the
website and keep that private or public.

\textbf{Tools and Resources}

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript,PHP, MySQL

\textbf{Challenge}

Main challenge for this project is finding a lot of users and collecting
information about a lot of shows that already exist. We also need to
manage a lot of data which will require high maintenance and if users
increase a lot the site will need scaling up which will also cost a lot.
Since there is no automatic system to add shows to the database, shows
need to be added on request and fulfilled by moderators and admins. If
too many requests come in it might take a while to fulfill every
request.
